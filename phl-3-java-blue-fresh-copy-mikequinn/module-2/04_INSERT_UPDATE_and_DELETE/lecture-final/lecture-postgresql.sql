-- TRANSACTIONS

-- 1. Try deleting all of the rows from the country language table and roll it back.
START TRANSACTION;
DELETE FROM countrylanguage;
SELECT * FROM countrylanguage;
ROLLBACK;
SELECT * FROM countrylanguage;

-- 2. Try updating all of the cities to be in the USA and roll it back
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE city SET countrycode='USA';
SELECT * FROM city;
ROLLBACK;


-- 3. Demonstrate INSERT USING SELECT then roll it back


--INSERT INTO countrylanguage (countrycode, language, isofficial, percentage) with a SELECT statement that returns
-- multiple rows with matching data type/count for INSERT. Will insert one new record for each of the
-- records returned by the SELECT.
--
-- this example will insert Klingon into countrylanguage for every country that currently
-- has English as a language. (English will still be there because this an INSERT not an UPDATE, so we are
-- just adding Klingon)
--
START TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO countrylanguage (countrycode, language, isofficial, percentage)
SELECT countrycode, 'Klingon',  false, .1 FROM countrylanguage WHERE language='English';
ROLLBACK;

-- should return 60 records until ROLLBACK, then be reset to 0 when 
-- INSERT above is rolled back
SELECT * FROM countrylanguage WHERE language='Klingon';

SELECT countrycode, language FROM countrylanguage WHERE countrycode IN 
(SELECT countrycode FROM countrylanguage WHERE language='English') ORDER BY countrycode, language;

-- 4. Demonstrate two different SQL connections trying to access the same table where one happens to be inside of a transaction but hasn't committed yet.



-- IF WE START A TRANSACTION AND UPDATE A VALUE:

-- 1) THAT VALUE WILL BE UPDATED FOR OUR SESSION BUT ***NOT*** ANY OTHER SESSIONS TRYING TO LOOK AT THE DATA
-- 2) IF ANOTHER SESSION IS TRYING TO MODIFY THE SAME DATA, IT WILL HANG UNTIL OUR TRANSACTION COMPLETES 
--    (IS EITHER ROLLED BACK OR COMMITTED). THIS IS KNOW AS WAITING ON A TABLE LOCK
-- 3) IF WE ROLLBACK THE TRANSACTION, OUR CHANGE WILL BE REVERTED AND WON"T BE VISIBLE TO OUR SEESION
--    OUR ANYONE ELSE'S
-- 4) IF WE COMMIT OUR TRANSACTION RATHER THAN ROLLING IT BACK, THE DATA WILL NOW BE PERMANENT
--    FOR ALL SESSIONS
-- 5) WHEN RUNNING IN DBVIS, IF YOUR START A TRANSACTION AND DO SOMETHING THAT CAUSES AN ERROR,
--    YOU WILL NEED TO MANUALLY CALL ROLLBACK (OR COMMIT BUT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE SINCE THERE
---   WAS AN ERROR) IN ORDER TO FINISH THE TRANSACTION. IF YOU DON'T DBVIS WILL PROBABLY COMPLAIN
---   AND AT THAT POINT YOU CAN MAUALLY ROLLBACK THE TRANSACTION IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO 
--    MODIFY DATA AGAIN.
