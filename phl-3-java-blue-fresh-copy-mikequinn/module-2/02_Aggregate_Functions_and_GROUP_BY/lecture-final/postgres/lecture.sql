-- Additional samples
-- You may alias column and table names to be more descriptive

-- Alias can also be used to create shorthand references for tables, such as "c" for city and "co" for country.
SELECT name FROM city AS c WHERE c.countrycode IN (SELECT code FROM country AS co WHERE co.indepyear IS NULL);

-- Ordering allows columns to be displayed in ascending order, or descending order (Look at Arlington)

-- Limiting results allows rows to be returned in 'limited' clusters,where LIMIT says how many, and OFFSET (optional) specifies the number of rows to skip

-- Most database platforms provide string functions that can be useful for working with string data. In addition to string functions, string concatenation is also usually supported, which allows us to build complete sentences if necessary.

-- Aggregate functions provide the ability to COUNT, SUM, and AVG, as well as determine MIN and MAX. Only returns a single row of value(s) unless used with GROUP BY.

-- Counts the number of rows in the city table

-- Also counts the number of rows in the city table

-- Gets the SUM of the population field in the city table, as well as
-- the AVG population, and a COUNT of the total number of rows.

SELECT SUM(population) AS total_population, AVG(population)AS AVG_POPULATION, count(*) AS row_count FROM city;

SELECT UPPER(name) FROM city;

-- Gets the MIN population and the MAX population from the city table.
SELECT MIN(population), MAX(population) FROM city;

-- Using a GROUP BY with aggregate functions allows us to summarize information for a specific column. For instance, we are able to determine the MIN and MAX population for each countrycode in the city table.
SELECT countrycode, MIN(population), MAX(population) FROM city GROUP BY countrycode ORDER BY countrycode DESC;
