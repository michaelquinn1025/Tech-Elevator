                <article>

                    <p>To understand the <span class="codefont">flex-basis</span> property, we need to understand how <span class="codefont">flex-grow</span> and <span class="codefont">flex-shrink</span> work.</p>
                    
                    <p>For these examples we will be working with these classes:</p>
                    <div class="codesample list-style-code-sample">
                        <pre class="block">            
    .flex-example-1 {
        border: 3px black solid;
        display: flex;
    }

    .box-flex {
        background-color: blueviolet;
        color: white;
        text-align: center;
        width: 100px;
        padding: 15px 5px;
        margin: 1px;
    }
                        </pre>
                    </div>

                    <p>The examples we are going to look at, we will be working with a div similar to this:</p>
                    
                    <div class="codesample list-style-code-sample">
                        <pre class="block">            
    &lt;div class="flex-example-1"&gt;
        &lt;span class="box-flex"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="box-flex"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="box-flex"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
                        </pre>
                    </div>

                    <p>This HTML gives us the results below - it renders each box at it's true size (100px).</p>

                    <div class="flex-example-1">
                        <span class="box-flex">A</span>
                        <span class="box-flex" >B</span>
                        <span class="box-flex">C</span>
                    </div>

                    <p>If we add <span class="codefont">flex-grow: 1</span> to the span containing B, it will stretch to fill all the extra space.</p>

                    <div class="flex-example-1">
                        <span class="box-flex">A</span>
                        <span class="box-flex  flex-grow" >B</span>
                        <span class="box-flex">C</span>
                    </div>

                    <p>If we also add <span class="codefont">flex-grow: 2</span> to the span containing C, it will stretch to twice the amount B stretches:</p>

                    <div class="flex-example-1">
                        <span class="box-flex">A</span>
                        <span class="box-flex flex-grow" >B</span>
                        <span class="box-flex flex-grow-2">C</span>
                    </div>

                    <p>If we remove the <span class="codefont">flex-grow: 1</span> from the span containing B and leave the <span class="codefont">flex-grow: 2</span> in the span containing span C, span B will no longer be allowed to grow and will shrink down to it's original size:</p>

                    <div class="flex-example-1">
                        <span class="box-flex">A</span>
                        <span class="box-flex" >B</span>
                        <span class="box-flex flex-grow-2">C</span>
                    </div>

                    <p>We can use the <span class="codefont">flex</span> property as shorthand for <span class="codefont">flex-grow</span>, <span class="codefont">flex-shrink</span>, and <span class="codefont">flex-basis</span> properties. This will help us understand <span class="codefont">flex-basis</span>.</p>
                    
                    <p>In the property <span class="codefont">flex: 1 0 200px</span>,  1 indicates the flex-grow value, 0 indicates the flex-shrink value, and 200px indicates the flex-basis value.</p>
                    
                    <p>If we leave the span containing C as above (<span class="codefont">flex-grow: 2</span>) but add <span class="codefont">flex: 1 0 200px</span> to the span containing B, we are saying that B is allowed to grow but the flex-basis specifies that B must take up AT LEAST 200px. As you can see, C is no longer 2 the times the amount B stretches because if B is at least 200px, there isn't room for C to grow more than it is. In the case that  <span class="codefont">flex-basis</span> is specified for an element with  <span class="codefont">flex-grow</span>, the  <span class="codefont">flex-basis</span> value indicates that the element must be at least the size specified by <span class="codefont">flex-basis</span> but can grow larger if need be. The math of how the proportions are calculated under this circumstance are complex but the main point here is that B has a minimum size.</p>
                   
                    
                    <div class="flex-example-1">
                        <span class="box-flex">A</span>
                        <span class="box-flex  flex-grow-basis-200px" >B</span>
                        <span class="box-flex flex-grow-2">C</span>
                    </div>

                    <p>If we leave B as above (<span class="codefont">flex: 1 0 200px</span>) and modify C to have no longer have a <span class="codefont">flex-grow</span> value, but rather to have <span class="codefont">flex-shrink: 1</span> (<span class="codefont">flex: 0 1</span>) we will see that it no longer grows and, thus, shrinks back down to it's original size while B stretches to fill the rest of the space.</p>
                    
                    <div class="flex-example-1">
                        <span class="box-flex">A</span>
                        <span class="box-flex  flex-grow-basis-200px" >B</span>
                        <span class="box-flex flex-shrink">C</span>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>However, if we do the same and specify a <span class="codefont">flex-basis</span> of 50px for C (<span class="codefont">flex: 0 1 50px</span>) we will see that C shrinks and will no longer be allowed to grow to be more than 50px. In the case that  <span class="codefont">flex-basis</span> is specified for an element with  <span class="codefont">flex-shrink</span>, the  <span class="codefont">flex-basis</span> value indicates that the element will shrink and cannot be larger than the <span class="codefont">flex-basis</span>  value. </p>

                    <div class="flex-example-1">
                        <span class="box-flex">A</span>
                        <span class="box-flex  flex-grow-basis-200px" >B</span>
                        <span class="box-flex flex-shrink-basis-50px">C</span>
                    </div>
