-- Let's find out who made payment 16666:
SELECT * FROM payment WHERE payment_id=16666;



-- Ok, that gives us a customer_id, but not the name. We can use the customer_id to get the name FROM the customer table

SELECT * FROM payment p

-- But when did they return the rental? Where would that data come from? From the rental table, so let’s join that.
SELECT p.*, c.first_name, c.last_name, r.return_date FROM payment p

-- ********* LEFT JOIN ***********

-- (There aren't any great examples of left joins in the "dvdstore" database, so the following queries are for the "world" database)

-- A Left join, selects all records from the "left" table and matches them with records from the "right" table if a matching record exists.

-- Let's display a list of all countries and their capitals, if they have some.

SELECT co.name, ci.name FROM country co
JOIN city ci ON co.capital = ci.id

-- Only 232 rows
-- But we’re missing entries:

-- There are 239 countries. So how do we show them all even if they don’t have a capital?
-- That’s because if the rows don’t exist in both tables, we won’t show any information for it. If we want to show data FROM the left side table everytime, we can use a different join:
SELECT * FROM country WHERE capital IS NULL;

SELECT co.name, co.capital, ci.name FROM country co
LEFT JOIN city ci ON co.capital = ci.id

-- *********** UNION *************

-- Back to the "dvdstore" database...

-- Gathers a list of all first names used by actors and customers
-- By default removes duplicates
SELECT first_name FROM customer
UNION
SELECT first_name FROM actor

-- Gather the list, but this time note the source table with 'A' for actor and 'C' for customer
SELECT first_name, 'C' FROM customer
UNION
SELECT first_name, 'A' FROM actor
